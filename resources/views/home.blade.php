                    <h3>Ever since I was a small boy I have been flying with my parents on airline flights. I have always wanted to become a pilot myself, but I was not sure how to do so. In December 2017, I flew a Cessna 172 for the first time and I was instantly hooked. Since then, I have worked consistently to gain my commercial pilot certificate with an instrument rating along with becoming a certificated flight instructor with an instrument rating. I love aviation and helping students be successful beginning their flying careers is truly priceless.</h3>

                    <hr class="grey">
                    <h3>I have always been fascinated by computers and the internet, and I began programming as a hobby in high school. Once I started college, I took my first formal computer science course and was instantly hooked on the computer science courses! Over the last few years, I have worked on a few personal projects along with the course required projects. Along with these personal projects I have worked at Simply Binary in Greenville, SC as an intern and also at Centre College as a student programmer. Feel free to take a look at my GitHub for a few of my recent projects! In the future I hope to get more involved in open source projects and begin a career as a software engineer.</h3>

While at Centre, I have taken many different courses in Math and Computer Science including, but not limited to, Abstract Algebra I/II, Differential Equations, Numerical Methods, Software Design, Artifical Intelligence, and Databases.</h3>
