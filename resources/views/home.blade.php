                    <h3>Ever since I was a small boy I have been flying with my parents on airline flights. I have always wanted to become a pilot myself, but I was not sure how to do so. In December 2017, I flew a Cessna 172 for the first time and I was instantly hooked. Since then, I have worked consistently to gain my private pilot certificate with an instrument rating, and my advanced and instrument ground instructor ratings. Check out my YouTube channel to follow along with me on my journey!</h3>

                    <h3>I have always been fascinated with computers and the internet and I have always wanted to learn as much as possible and learn how to code. Recently I have had the opportunity to work on some programming projects and I have been fascinated with the simplicity and power of programming. Check out my GitHub to see some of my projects!</h3>

                    <h3>I hope to one day become an airline pilot and get to travel the world! I also want to continue developing smaller programming projects on the side as a hobby. This summer I plan to instruct a few ground school courses at the Flight School of Greenville in Greenville, SC and hopefully become a certified flight instructor within the years to come!</h3>
